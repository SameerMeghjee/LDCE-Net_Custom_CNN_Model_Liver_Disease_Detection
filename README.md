# LDCE-Net: Liver Fibrosis Classification from Ultrasound Images

## 🧠 Overview
LDCE-Net is a custom, lightweight deep learning model designed from scratch to classify liver fibrosis stages (Normal, Fibrosis, Cirrhosis) using grayscale ultrasound images. It is optimized to run on CPU-only systems and designed specifically for use in real-time clinical environments.

- ⚡ Fast and resource-efficient
- ✅ Trained from scratch (no pre-trained models)
- 🏥 Designed for clinical deployment (no GPU required)
- 🎛️ Simple GUI using Streamlit
- 📊 Training includes stratified sampling, dropout, and regularization to prevent overfitting

## 📥 Dataset
This project uses the publicly available dataset from Kaggle:
🔗 [Liver Histopathology Fibrosis Ultrasound Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vibhingupta028/liver-histopathology-fibrosis-ultrasound-images)

After downloading, organize it into subfolders like:
```
Liver Ultrasounds/
├── F0-Normal/
├── F1-Fibrosis/
└── F2-Cirrhosis/
```

---

## 🧪 Training the Model
```bash
python train.py
```
This will:
- Train the model with stratified sampling
- Save best weights to `ldce_model.pt`
- Output plots to `plots/`

---

## 📊 Sample Training Metrics
- **Best validation accuracy**: ~87.6%
- **Train accuracy**: steadily rises to ~85%
- **No overfitting**: due to dropout + augmentations

---

## 🚀 GUI with Streamlit
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
Upload any grayscale ultrasound image. The model will predict:
- F0-Normal
- F1-Fibrosis
- F2-Cirrhosis
